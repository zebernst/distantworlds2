        <ul class="ul-std"><li class="li-std">Fleet Roster registration for the Distant Worlds II Expedition is now open.</li>
            <li class="li-std">The expedition will launch when the final 'Beyond' content update is live and stable - <span class="highlight">circa Q4 2018 / Q1 2019</span>.</li>
            <li class="li-std">There is zero indication that any aspect of the <a class="a-std" href="internal link">Community Goal Proposal</a> will be present during the expedition.</li></ul>

    <h3 class="h3-std">Distant Worlds II</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="p-std">Distant Worlds II will be a journey to the far outer rim and back, with the outbound journey culminating at Beagle Point. We also plan to organize the return trip, and this will be a more indirect route home taking participants through some seldom travelled regions in an attempt to retrace the USS Voyager's journey home from the delta quadrant.</p>
    <p class="p-std">The expedition will proceed whether the Community Goal Proposal is accepted or not. The overall journey (there and back) will cover at least 200,000 light years. The map below should be considered as a rough approximation of the intended routes for the time being as the full itineraries and schedules, including waypoint locations, for both "Outbound" and "The Journey Home" will be posted later this year with a more detailed route map.</p>
    <img class="img-std content-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/9LskGi2.png">
    <br>
    <h3 class="h3-std">Reaching Beagle Point</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="p-std">Beagle Point is where the 'Outbound' journey will end and 'The Voyage Home' stage begins. To reach this star system you will need a ship that can jump a minimum of <span class="highlight">33.4&nbsp;LYs</span>. Commanders thinking of taking short-range ships, please make sure your ship has a range of at least <span class="warning">16.8&nbsp;LYs</span> as a Jumponium level 3 fuel boost will then make Beagle Point attainable.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="h3-std">Time Commitment Requirements (A Rough Guide)</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="p-std">For the "Outbound" journey an initial timeframe of 16 weeks to reach Beagle Point has been set. This is currently a placeholder and may change when the exact expedition itinerary and schedule is ironed out later this year. For reference; DW1 was a 12-week outbound journey that took place long before ships had increased FSD ranges via engineering. <a class="a-std" href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/209331-Distant-Worlds-Fleet-Roster">571 commanders</a> in pre-engineering era ships completed DW1 on schedule. For the outbound journey on DW2, the new fleet will have <span class="highlight">at least 4 extra weeks</span> and the ability to take longer ranged ships to accomplish what the DW1 fleet did back in 3302. For typical time management vs ship ranges, this should give you an idea of travel times on DW2:</p>
    <ul class="ul-std"><li class="li-std">20 minutes to travel around 1,000 LYs for a 50 LY ship</li>
        <li class="li-std">30 minutes to travel around 1,000 LYs for a 40 LY ship</li>
        <li class="li-std">40 minutes to travel around 1,000 LYs for a 30 LY ship</li>
        <li class="li-std">60-70 minutes to travel around 1,000 LYs for a 20 LY ship</li></ul>
    <p class="p-std">Average weekly waypoint to waypoint gatherings will be between 4,000 and 6,000 LYs apart (this is subject to change once the full itinerary is ironed out). Neutron jumping may help cut down travel times too, if you don't mind a little risk.</p>
    <p class="p-std">Also take into consideration that this is just travel time to reach each weekly waypoint gathering on time. You'll obviously need time to actually explore or take part in whatever events, missions, and projects that will be occuring at those weekly meets. Effectively, the less gametime you have, the longer ranged ship you should take. So get engineering them! In addition spend the weeks leading up to launch stockpiling Jumponium (highly recommended for those taking short ranged vessels!).</p>
    <p class="p-std">Whatever waypoint to waypoint pacing is set, commanders signing up to these kinds of long distance and long duration events need to be able to commit a minimum amount of gametime per week if they wish to experience the social aspects of fleet exploration.</p>
    <p class="p-std">On the premise that the Community Goal idea for the expedition is accepted, the stated timescales will be adjusted in accordance to whatever is required by Frontier. Being part of the DW2 fleet roster is not mandatory as any CG would naturally be open to all players, whether they want to be associated with DW2 or not.</p>
    <p class="p-std">Some of the planned content that will be incorporated into the expedition includes the following waypoint events & projects (subject to change):</p>
        <ul class="ul-std"><li class="li-std">POI scouting missions for the Galactic Mapping Project (inc. naming of interesting systems, worlds, and geological surface features for the GMP).</li>
        <li class="li-std">Cataloguing geysers, fumaroles, and organics for the Milky Way Society of Organics and Geology Project.</li>
        <li class="li-std">Environmental Space Anomaly discovery and cataloguing (anomalies have been hinted at by FD for inclusion in the 'Beyond' series).</li>
        <li class="li-std">The Scientific Surveyor Project (collating a wealth of statistics on types of star systems, worlds, and asteroid fields- among other things), and creating documents on what the DW2 fleet discovered by journey's end.</li>
        <li class="li-std">Basecamp Events (inc. SRV Tag Extreme, Whack-a-Rat, SRV Canyon Races, Fighter Races, SRV Mountain Climbing, SRV Destruction Derby).</li></ul>
    <br>
    <h3 class="h3-std">Why Early Registration?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="p-std">Despite the main event being schedule for later this year, the roster process has been opened early for three main reasons; Firstly there will be a DW2 waypoint scouting event set up in Q1/Q2 - this will invite any interested fleet members to help seek out and locate specific locations for the main expedition to visit during DW2. It'll be a series of small-scale missions held throughout the spring and early summer of 2018 (more details will be posted about this after the Q1 update is live). Secondly, the roster will give us an idea of what the most popular roles will be - so this gives us plenty of time to see what kind of events and projects we need to flesh out and incorporate in readiness for the main event. And thirdly if there's enough support for the expeditions goals to incorporate resource gathering (eg. fuel mining for Carrier/Megaship logistical support), the ideas discussed here will be proposed on FDev's upcoming focused feedbacks.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="h3-std">Roles Within The Fleet</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="p-std">Fleet roles on DW2 will be linked to specific events and projects that will be incorporated into the overall expedition. Some of the listed roles could be subject to change depending on new gameplay mechanics or features appearing with the 'Beyond' series of updates. If current roles become unviable, or new ones get incorporated, we'll announce it on this thread. For roster purposes, you can choose up to two fleet roles, but this does not prevent you from taking on multiple roles during DW2. You can also edit your chosen roles anytime you like using the edit link you'll be provided with once you submit your fleet registration.</p>

            <h3 class="h3-std">Explorer</h3>
            <p class="p-std">The default role that anyone not selecting a specific role is automatically assigned. Explorers will make up the bulk of the fleet and are those that are not fussed on specialization. During the journey Explorers will discover interesting stellar, planetary, or environmental POIs (like planetary nebulae etc). The very best of these POIs will then be used by Tour Guides, the <a class="a-std" href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub">Galactic Mapping Team</a>, and Fleet Astrophotographers to visit and catalogue during the expedition and waypoint visits.</p></div></div>

            <h3 class="h3-std">Fuel Rat</h3>
            <p class="p-std">Part of the Resource Acquisition Teams [R.A.Ts] we hope to incorporate into DW2. The Fuel Rat role will not only require the pilot to fit a limpet control module, but they will also double as fuel mineral haulers and help refuel fleet Carriers during mining operations (provided logistical support for such ships is introduced - pure speculation at this point). Ships with a large cargo capacity are recommended for this role.</p></div></div>

            <p class="p-std">Part of the Resource Acquisition Teams [R.A.Ts] we hope to incorporate into DW2. For the outbound journey, a miners primary role will be to scout for and mine the essential ice-based minerals needed to refuel the flagship (again, this is speculative at this point). Miners will also be needed during a possible construction Community Goal at Sag-A* and Beagle Point (if the CG proposal is accepted by FD). Major resource gathering operations will be overseen and coordinated by the Rock Rats whose task will be to set up group mining operations and work in conjunction with fleet haulers and Fuel Rats during the refueling procedure and CG construction phase of the mission. <span class="highlight">Please be aware that this role is wholly dependent on either the CG proposal being implemented, or Megaship refueling support being introduced in the Beyond series. If there is no practical reason to incorporate Miners on DW2, the role will become obsolete for this expedition.</span></p></div></div>
